    <h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

    <p>GENERAL ALLENBY having announced that all the holy places in
    Jerusalem will be protected, the KAISER is about to issue a
    manifesto to his Turkish subjects, pointing out that so much
    time has elapsed since he was there in 1898 that the place can
    no longer be considered as holy as it was.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It is now stated that the leader of the Sinn Feiners is an
    American citizen. It is hardly likely, however, in view of the
    friendly relations prevailing between ourselves and the United
    States, that the point will be pressed.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Another lengthy pamphlet on the subject of cheese has been
    issued by the FOOD-CONTROLLER. The Department now claims that
    there is no excuse for even the simplest grocer failing to
    recognise a cheese when he sees it.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A painful story comes from the North of England. It appears
    that a man left his home saying that he would obtain a pound of
    Devonshire butter or die. He was only thirty-four years of
    age.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A leaflet containing President WILSON'S recent speech to
    Congress has been passed by the CENSOR, who, however, does not
    wish it to be understood that he could not have improved on it
    if he had cared to.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A grave state of affairs is reported by a New York paper. It
    appears that America will shortly ask Mexico to make
    revolutions a criminal offence. They'll be stopping baseball
    next.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A question put by Mr. FIELD in the House of Commons
    suggested that M.P.s should travel on railways free of charge.
    The chief objection seems to be that they would be sure to want
    return tickets.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A domestic servant points out in a contemporary that she has
    worked from seven in the morning until ten o'clock at night for
    six months without a break. Another domestic who holds the
    smash-as-smash-can record wonders where this poor girl learnt
    her business.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Discussing the London taxi strike a contemporary remarks
    that both sides ought to meet. Failing that, we think that at
    least one side might meet.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Writing to <i>The Evening News</i> a Maidstone gentleman
    protested against the action of the authorities who covered up
    the Tank in Trafalgar Square on Sundays. On the first Sunday it
    seems that somebody tripped over it.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>There appears to be an epidemic of trouble in the animal
    world. An elephant at the Zoo has just died, while only a few
    days ago a travelling crane collapsed at Glasgow.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Burglars who looted an Oxford Street shop last week obtained
    admission by making a hole through a brick wall. It is supposed
    the shop door was closed.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Surely it is only hindering matters for people to keep
    writing to the Press on the matter of the appointment of a
    Minister of Health. It seems to be overlooked that so far
    <i>The Daily Mail</i> has not indicated who should be appointed
    to that position.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The Government having reaffirmed their statement that they
    have "no further fear of submarines," it is felt to be high
    time that someone in authority should break it to the U-boats
    that they might as well give it up and go home.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The gentleman who wrote to the Press offering to sell eggs
    at <i>4s. 7d.</i> a dozen has since explained that he merely
    wanted to show how much higher the market price is than his
    would have been if he had really had any eggs to sell.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>We understand that it has not yet been decided in Berlin
    what the Sultan of TURKEY thinks of the capture of
    Jerusalem.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Four letters of QUEEN ELIZABETH have just been sold by
    auction. Strangely enough, nothing is said in them about her
    having no quarrel with the Spanish people, but only with their
    Monarch.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"Is the potato the saviour of the Fatherland?" asks the
    <i>Deutsche Tageszeitung</i>. Another slight to the
    ALL-HIGHEST.</p>
    <hr />

    <hr />

    <p>From a review of Lord LISTER'S "Life":&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"It was in Edinburgh that he struck his most famous
        patient, Henley, who has a record of the 'Chief' in his
        rhymes and rhythms, 'In Hospital.'"&mdash;<i>Daily
        Paper</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>But it was not in reference to this incident that HENLEY
    wrote, "My head is bloody but unbowed."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <blockquote>
        <p>"If all fools were rationed there could be no fixed
        scale."&mdash;<i>Star</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Of course not; we have always noticed that the bigger the
    fool the more he eats.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Bassano is a nice town, by a dam
        site."&mdash;<i>Canadian Paper</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>But a Canadian friend tells us there are others "a dam sight
    nicer."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <blockquote>
        <p>"The German government has a terrific explosive, which
        is being held in reserve to the last.... It is said that a
        bomb weighing scarcely ten kilometres can annihilate
        everything within a radius of two thousand
        feet."&mdash;<i>New York Herald</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>We do not mind saying that we are frankly afraid of a bomb
    that weighs about six miles.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <blockquote>
        <p>"TIPPERARY BURGLARY.&mdash;Tipperary Temperance Club
        premises have been gurgled."&mdash;<i>Cork
        Examiner</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>GILBERT'S burglar up-to-date: "He loves to hear the
    Temperance Club a-gurgling."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <blockquote>
        <p>"General Allenby, no doubt, will go in due time to the
        House of Lords, and military men are taking a jocular
        interest in his selection of a title. Lord Bathsheba might
        serve, or Lord Hebron. Lord Jerusalem smacks of the
        jocose."&mdash;<i>Birmingham Daily Post</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>For our part we thought "Lord Bathsheba" rather funny
    too.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>An Historical Curiosity.</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"At Blenheim is a small glass-topped table, which
        contains the sword of the great Duke of Marlborough, also a
        letter addressed by him to Sarah Duchess from the field of
        Waterloo."&mdash;<i>The Queen</i>.</p>

    <h2>THE CADET'S FRIEND.</h2>

    <p>MISUNDERSTOOD.&mdash;You were in the wrong. The custom of
    throwing chicken-bones over the right shoulder is practised
    only in the mess of the 13th Bavarian Landsturm Regiment.
    Still, considering that you had only joined that day, we think
    your colonel acted hastily.</p>

    <p>AS YOU WERE (and several other Correspondents).&mdash;The
    executive order for the new combined movement of "About turn
    and left incline" is given when the joint of the left big toe
    is opposite the right instep (in Rifle regiments substitute
    right for left and left for right).</p>

    <p>SUBALTERN.&mdash;Your company commander is without authority
    for reproving you for shaving off your moustache. All the same,
    judging by the photograph you enclose, we think you would be
    wise to keep as much of your face covered as possible.</p>

    <p>FIELD-MARSHAL'S BATON.&mdash;No, you are mistaken in
    supposing that a private soldier under close arrest may spend
    two hours daily in the regimental canteen. The only stimulant
    allowed him is one glass (2 oz., Mark IV.) of port daily with
    the orderly officer when the latter inspects the guardroom.</p>

    <p>SUFFERER.&mdash;(1) No, White Star gas is never employed by
    army dentists. (2) No, you need not take your respirator with
    you. You hire the an&aelig;sthetist's at a small charge.</p>

    <p>PINK RATS.&mdash;You assume that if you were appointed a
    mopper-up you would <i>ex-officio</i> be put in charge of the
    rum-ration. This is not the case. The function of moppers-up is
    to collect souvenirs for the new Great War Museum, to be housed
    in one of the four remaining London hotels.</p>

    <p>OBSERVER.&mdash;German minnenwerfer are not dangerous if
    their flight is carefully watched, as they swerve to the left,
    and their landing-place can thus be fairly accurately judged.
    Two varieties, however&mdash;the windupwerfer and the
    hoppitwerfer&mdash;swerve to the right. The googliwerfer
    swerves both ways.</p>

    <p>SOCIABLE.&mdash;The correct method of dealing with snipers
    in a house is to ring the front-door bell with the thumb and
    forefinger of the right hand, at the same time smartly
    inserting a charge of cordite into the letter-box with the
    left. Indents for postmen's uniforms for this purpose should be
    rendered to D.A.D.O.S. in triplicate.</p>

    <p>STATISTICIAN.&mdash;The world's record is held by the
    adjutant of the pioneer battalion of the 371st Silesian Foot
    Regiment. There is unimpeachable evidence to prove that he was
    heard drinking gravy soup from a distance of 477 metres. The
    night was calm.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>IF THE PAPER SHORTAGE INCREASES.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Some Future Press Items.</i>)</h4>

    <p>FICTION FAMINE IN THE PROVINCES.</p>

    <p>From many districts come reports of great difficulty in
    obtaining novels. Yesterday in a well-known Midland town the
    unusual sight was observed of long queues outside the chief
    booksellers'. Several libraries displayed notices bearing the
    words, "No GARVICE to-day"; and quite early in the afternoon
    best quality BENSONS were practically unobtainable, even by
    regular customers.</p>

    <p>FIRST CONDITIONAL SALE PROSECUTION.</p>

    <p>Much interest has been roused in East Anglia over the fine
    of one hundred pounds inflicted by the Bench upon a local
    bookseller, found guilty of the Conditional Sale of Fiction.
    The chief witness, a retired stockbroker, proved that defendant
    refused to supply his order for a shilling's worth of O. HENRY
    unless he also purchased a remainder copy of <i>Wanderings
    Round Widnes</i> (published at twelve-and-six net). The
    Chairman, remarking that the case was a specially flagrant one,
    expressed a hope that the result would protect the public from
    such imposition in future.</p>

    <p>VALUABLE DISCOVERY.</p>

    <p>In view of the serious shortage in reliable fiction, nothing
    less than a sensation is likely to result from the reported
    discovery of an entirely satisfactory BARCLAY substitute in
    tabloid form. Should the tidings prove well authenticated, the
    patrons of circulating libraries will have good reason for
    satisfaction. The new preparation is said to be even sweeter
    than the original article, and equally sustaining.</p>

    <p>FICTION CARDS COMING.</p>

    <p>On inquiry at the Albert Hall (recently taken over as
    offices by the Literature Control Committee), our
    representative was emphatically assured that, should the system
    of voluntary romance-rationing prove unsatisfactory, some form
    of compulsion will become inevitable. It was pointed out that
    the indicated maximum of one novel or magazine per head weekly
    is amply sufficient for all reasonable requirements. The
    attention of the public is further called to the need of making
    the fullest and most economical use of the allowance, and not
    wasting the advertisement pages, which contain much readable
    and stimulating matter, the patent medicine paragraphs
    especially being rich in the finest imaginative fiction.</p>

    <h3>OR, BIG-WIGS AT PLAY.</h3>

    <p>Somebody in the Old Country discovered, with the aid of a
    hint or two, that the tooth (exact molar not specified) of the
    General Staff Officer 3 was sweet. As a natural result a
    certain famous firm of confectioners was indented upon heavily.
    Day in, day out, perspiring orderlies arrived festooned with
    parcels containing all kinds of wonderful things crammed with
    all sorts of wonderful surprises. Life in the General Staff
    Office resolved itself into four meals a day between
    sweetmeats. The whole routine underwent a complete change.
    Everyone who visited the place made, as a matter of course, a
    bee line for the General Staff Canteen cupboard, and while
    searching for the particular dainty he fancied broached the
    subject of his visit in general terms. He then turned to the
    officer he was addressing and politely offered him the kind of
    delicacy he thought would blend best with the matter in
    hand.</p>

    <p>And then Chockchaw arrived. It began by letting the G.S.O.3
    down badly the first day. All unsuspicious of its properties he
    rang up a Division, popped a piece into his mouth and waited.
    In due time the call came through, but no word could he utter.
    "Chockchaw lockjaw" had set in. Only a horrible sound like the
    squelching of ten gum-boots in the mud reached the indignant
    Staff at the other end. After a minute's monologue they rang
    off in disgust.</p>

    <p>Yet in spite of all difficulties the vogue of Chockchaw
    swept through the Corps. It is such a ripe, rich,
    full-flavoured irresistible concoction. Disadvantages there
    are, of course, but, on the other hand, if you want to be
    quiet, it is easy to lure the unsuspecting intruder on to
    Chockchaw and leave it at that. After vain efforts the poor
    fellow usually creeps away like a cat with too big a bone and
    chews himself back to speech round the corner. He seldom
    returns, and if he does&mdash;there is always more Chockchaw.
    Should he refuse it this time you can take a piece yourself and
    save the trouble of answering, anyway.</p>

    <p>Chockchaw entailed more perilous chances than at first
    appeared probable. Indeed at one time it looked like seriously
    impeding the course of final victory.</p>

    <p>On a certain brown November day the G.S.O.2 suddenly jumped
    up from his chair, ran to the Canteen cupboard, popped a piece
    of Chockchaw into his mouth (because he had a difficult March
    Table to make out and needed sustenance) and fell to work
    whistling like an ordinary human being (who cannot whistle).
    I.O. (not the gadfly, but the Intelligence Officer) dropped in
    with his usual list of suspected hostile emplacements. He took
    Chockchaw in case he was asked pertinent questions. He has to
    be <i>so</i> careful what he gives away unofficially. He knows
    so <i>much</i>. Germans try to steal his summaries to find out
    what their own intentions really are. The A.D.C. dropped in for
    his usual morning chat and Chockchaw. The Staff Officer R.A.
    (S.O.R.A.), that inveterate sweet-guzzler, also dropped in.</p>

    <p>"Hullo, what are you fellows munching?" asked the General,
    coming in muddied all over. "Give me a bit; I've had no
    breakfast. What's the news, Intelligence?" (No answer) "Is that
    Move Order done, by the way?" (No answer.) "Why, what
    the&mdash;Good Lord, I'm <i>stuck</i>! What stuff is this
    you've given me?" And there they all stood chumping in
    silence.</p>

    <p>The telephone rang. The absurdity of a dumb Staff tickled
    everybody. They winked their appreciation of the situation at
    one another. Not to be able to say "Thank you" on being
    instructed "with reference to my telegram of to-day for L/Cpl.
    Plunkett read L/Cpl. Plonkett," appealed to them. Amidst the
    chuckles and gluggels of all, the G.S.O.3 was obliged to lift
    the receiver. Something of the seriousness of the occasion must
    have communicated itself to the others, for they crowded round
    him, mumbling and munching sympathetically. Speechless, the
    poor fellow wrote hastily on a buff slip of paper a Name, and
    passed it round. It was the name of an Excessively Resplendent
    One, whose lightest word results in headlines in the less
    expensive daily press.</p>

    <p>A frightful panic came over all. What&mdash;a General Staff
    ceasing to function even for a minute? It was unthinkable. The
    news would be flashed through to all concerned and become the
    subject of conversation in ten thousand messes that evening. It
    must not be. Never was there such a kneading and gnashing of
    teeth. But to no purpose. You cannot hurry Chockchaw; time, and
    time alone, will defeat it. The General tried to pack it all
    into one cheek. Useless; to attempt to sculpture in seccotine
    would have been a simpler task. The G.S.O.2 tried a frontal
    swallow, but only lined his throat more and more thickly until
    respiration became difficult. The S.O.R.A. nearly swallowed his
    tongue. The A.D.C., having cricked his jaw in the first five
    seconds, counted ten and threw up the sponge. The voice at the
    telephone became louder and more insistent. Flushed, hot and
    flurried, the G.S.O.3 thrust the receiver into the hands of the
    G.S.O.2, who handed it on to the General, who dropped it.
    Nobody spoke. Only the crackling and cackling voice could be
    heard from the receiver as it hung face downwards at the end of
    its cord.</p>

    <p>It was a moment demanding imagination. Naturally the
    Intelligence Officer felt the responsibility. He stepped
    forward, slapped the mouthpiece three times with the palm of
    his hand, rang off, rang on and slapped it again. The effect at
    the other end must have been horrible, but it achieved its
    purpose. By the time connection had been restored and the blood
    of the Signal Master demanded, the A.D.C. had cheated with a
    handkerchief and was able to gasp out that the Corps Commander
    would enjoy seeing the Resplendent One any time that day.</p>

    <p>Thus the honour of the General Staff was saved, the
    Intelligence Officer vindicated and the vogue of Chockchaw
    brought to an untimely end.</p>

    <p>"You ought," said the General severely to the
    G.S.O.3&mdash;"you ought to be unstuck for bringing such stuff
    into the office."</p>

    <p>"I have never wished so hard in my life, Sir, to be
    unstuck," said he.</p>

    <h2>THE SUPERIOR SEX.</h2>

    <p>"You are late again," said Clara, as I entered our domestic
    portal. "What is it this time?"</p>

    <p>Gently but firmly I explained the reason. A certain amount
    of tact was necessary, for my wife does not care for any
    remarks that appear to reflect upon her sex.</p>

    <p>"Owing to the present abnormal state of things, my dear," I
    said, "our office is now almost entirely staffed by women. In
    many ways this is an improvement. Their refining influence upon
    the dress and deportment of the few remaining male members of
    the staff is distinctly noticeable. But there are, I regret to
    say, certain drawbacks. Admittedly our superiors in many
    respects, in others they are not, I am afraid, equal to the
    situation. Take, for instance, matters of detail where
    you&mdash;I mean they&mdash;should excel. I asked Miss Philpott
    to write a letter&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Did you post that letter for me this morning?" said Clara.
    "If Mrs. Roberts doesn't get it she won't know where to meet me
    to-morrow."</p>

    <p>It is a woman's privilege to wander from the point at issue.
    I told Clara somewhat shortly that I had posted the letter,
    although naturally I did not remember doing so. A man who has
    hundreds of petty details to deal with every day, as I have,
    develops an automatic memory&mdash;a subconscious mechanism
    which never fails him.</p>

    <p>I explained this to Clara. "Not once in five thousand times
    would it allow me to pass the pillar-box with an unposted
    letter in my pocket. Perhaps it is the vivid red&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"And perhaps your vivid imagination," said my wife. "Well, I
    am glad you posted the letter, for Mrs. Roberts, as you know,
    never received the one you posted ten days ago."</p>

    <p>"I took that matter up very firmly with the local
    postmaster," I said. "He explained to me that letters are now
    almost entirely sorted and delivered by women, and he was
    afraid mistakes sometimes happened. And just to satisfy you
    about this last one, which I put as usual in my breast pocket
    at the back of my other papers&mdash;" I produced the contents
    of my pocket. As I expected the letter was not there.</p>

    <p>"Why do you carry so many papers in your pocket? What are
    they all about?"</p>

    <p>"Candidly, my dear, I do not know. Without the element of
    surprise life would be unbearably monotonous. That element I
    deliberately carry with me in my breast pocket. When a dull
    moment comes I empty my pockets. It would surprise
    you&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Nothing you do surprises me," said Clara. "Now go upstairs,
    please, and make yourself tidy. Have a dull moment&mdash;not
    more than one, for dinner is nearly ready&mdash;and get rid of
    those papers."</p>

    <p>Although my wife has not a logical process of thought, at
    times she makes sensible remarks. I took her advice. As I
    anticipated I had some surprises.</p>

    <p>A few important business memoranda, a sugar form, two income
    tax demands, a number of private letters and an unpaid coal
    account made up the collection. There was really nothing I
    could part with. Luckily I found two duplicates of the coal
    account. These I could spare. As I opened one of them Mrs.
    Roberts's letter fell out of it.</p>

    <p>I had just time to catch the post. I managed to reach the
    front-door unobserved. My wife opened the dining-room window to
    tell me that dinner was ready. I told her I had forgotten to
    post a very important business letter.</p>

    <p>"A most unusual occurrence," I said.</p>

    <p>"Mary can post it for you. Dinner's on the table." Clara
    extended her hand for the letter. I explained that it was so
    very important that I could not even trust Mary.</p>

    <p>"Mary's sex is, of course, against her," said my wife, "but
    I'll tell her to hold the letter out at arm's length. You can
    see her all the way from the window and watch her put it in the
    pillar-box."</p>

    <p>A little candour is sometimes necessary.</p>

    <p>"Strangely enough," I said, "the five-thousandth chance has
    come off. It is true the letter is important, but the business
    is yours, and the letter is addressed to Mrs. Roberts. I forgot
    to post it this morning."</p>

    <p>"I know you did," said Clara. "You left it behind, and I
    posted it myself."</p>

    <p>Here I saw that I was going to score. "Then what is this?" I
    asked in triumph.</p>

    <p>"This," said Clara, taking it from me, "is the letter you
    forgot to post ten days ago."</p>

    <h2>THE FOOD OF THE FAMOUS.</h2>

    <p>The publication of Lord RHONDDA'S daily menu will, we hope,
    lead other prominent people who are striving to follow his good
    example to divulge the details of their dietary. But in case
    their natural modesty may prevent them from doing so, Mr. Punch
    ventures to supply a few unauthorised particulars.</p>

    <p>The source of Mr. LLOYD GEORGE'S boundless energy has long
    been a mystery. It is now known to be derived from a raw leek
    eaten on rising, and a dinner of Welsh rabbit, made from a
    modicum of Government cheese and half a slice of war bread.</p>

    <p>With Mr. BONAR LAW all meals are oatmeals. A plate of
    porridge at daybreak, bannocks slightly margarined, when
    possible, for lunch, and a stiff cup of gruel just after
    Question time keep him alert and smiling.</p>

    <p>Thanks to the Spartan habits formed during his connection
    with both services, belt-tightening has no terrors for Mr.
    WINSTON CHURCHILL. A quid of Navy tobacco suffices for
    breakfast, and his only other meal consists of a slice of bully
    beef with a hard biscuit served on an inverted
    packing-case.</p>

    <p>The wild rumours recently current as to the amount of
    nutriment required for the upkeep of Mr. G.K. CHESTERTON have
    now been happily set at rest. The needful calories for
    twenty-four hours of his strenuous existence are supplied by
    two cups of cocoa, a shred of dried toast, a Brazil nut, a
    glass of sodawater and a grilled banana.</p>
    <hr />

    <blockquote>
        <p>"In one case the good cows from one herd had an average
        production of 9,592 lbs. milk, and 406 lbs. of fat, while
        the poor cows had a production of only 3,098 lbs. of milk
        and 119 lbs. of tea."&mdash;<i>Farming News</i>.</p>

        his trench tick and rushed towards them. Why they did not
        fire upon him is one of those little mysteries which will
        probably never be explained."&mdash;<i>Daily Paper</i>.</p>

    <h2>THE PERFECT CUSTOMER.</h2>

    <p>It was a very ordinary country sale of work. The Countess of
    Bilberry declared it open in a neat little speech, and then
    bought generously from every stall: her daughter, whose smile
    nobody could resist, did a fine trade with raffle tickets for
    the record pumpkin produced by the local allotments: Mrs. Dodd,
    the Rector's wife, presided over a pair of scales and a
    strictly rationed tea, and all the rest of the village sold
    vegetables and socks and pincushions, and tried to pretend that
    antimacassars and shaving tidies and woolwork waistbelts were
    the most desirable things in the world when they were made by
    wounded men at the nearest Red Cross Hospital, in whose aid the
    sale was held.</p>

    <p>But there was one unique figure amongst all the folk who
    knew each other, and each other's clothes, and each other's
    clothes' cost, so well. She arrived at the Village Hall in a
    pony-carriage, drawn by the ugliest little pony that ever
    sniffed oats. She was very quietly and very tastefully dressed,
    and, instead of concentrating on the well-laden stalls of
    garden produce or the orderly stacks of knitted comforts, or
    the really useful baskets, she went straight to the stall which
    even Mrs. Dodd, who had the kindest heart in the countryside,
    had been compelled to relegate to a dark corner. There was
    woolwork run riot over cushions of incredible hardness; there
    were candle-shades guaranteed to catch alight at the mere sight
    of a match; there were crochet dressing-table mats, and there
    was a three-legged stool on which even a fairy could not have
    sat without danger of a break-down.</p>

    <p>The youngest Miss Dodd, a severely practical young lady of
    sixteen, who was presiding at this stall, jumped up in surprise
    at the sight of a customer, and in doing so knocked over a
    glass box bound with red and white and blue ribbon, with
    "Handkerchiefs" painted across the corner in a design of
    forget-me-nots. There was very little glass box left when she
    picked it up, and the splinters had made a good many little
    craters in the surface of a big bowl of clotted cream, labelled
    "Positively the last appearance for the Duration of the War,"
    which was at the corner of the next stall.</p>

    <p>The little stranger said that she would take the box and the
    damaged cream too; she bought a whole family of crochet mats
    with centres of orange woollen loops; three pincushions made of
    playing cards discharged as no longer fit for active service; a
    table-centre with pen-painting of the Allied flags, and a
    letter-case with the badges of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page413"
       id="page413"></a>[pg 413]</span> Dominions worked in wool
       and "Across the sea, A letter from thee," straggling wearily
       across one corner. Then there was an antimacassar in purple
       and magenta sateen, with yellow daffodils making a brave
       attempt to flourish in unlikely surroundings.</p>

    <p>At the next stall she bought a photograph frame which had
    lost its prop in an unequal contest with a tea-tray which had
    collapsed from the heartiness of the Rector's clapping at the
    conclusion of the Countess's speech; and a Noah's Ark from
    which the star performer and his very best beasts had somehow
    disappeared.</p>

    <p>Then the little lady paused before the live-stock stall.</p>

    <p>"There isn't anything really hideous here," she murmured to
    herself; "but I think that puppy&mdash;it's never had its tail
    cut, and nobody will ever know whether it's a sealyham, a
    spaniel or even a dash of a setter&mdash;I will take the puppy,
    please," she added, "as soon as I've had some tea. After that I
    will see what is left. You have such nice things."</p>

    <p>After tea she went back to the youngest Miss Dodd and
    collected a few more of the more glaring atrocities, paid her
    bills, and then went off to her pony-carriage; the youngest
    Miss Dodd, very much inclined to giggle, bearing armfuls of odd
    purchases in her wake, crowned by the bowl of cream and the
    mongrel pup. She handed them in and was just going away when
    the little old lady pressed a piece of paper into her hand.</p>

    <p>"I don't like to worry people," she said gently, "but if you
    have time you might read this. It has been a great opportunity
    to-day; I don't often find so much to be done&mdash;and I shall
    love the puppy."</p>

    <p>The youngest Miss Dodd watched the start of the ugly pony
    with a snigger and then went back into the lighted hall to read
    the pamphlet. It was a touching little document&mdash;many
    people know it well&mdash;and the youngest Miss Dodd, who had
    never been known to sentimentalize over anything before, blew
    her nose rather violently when she had read it.</p>

    <p>"Bless her dear little soul!" she said to herself: "I don't
    wonder that pup was trying to kiss her. I only hope she won't
    try to eat that cream with the glass in it, or give it to the
    pup." For the pamphlet was the Rules for Membership and a
    treatise on the Objects and Methods of the "Society for Buying
    What Nobody Wants."</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <p><i>Monday, December 10th</i>.&mdash;One would gather from
    the hoardings that the Government wished to encourage the sale
    of War Bonds by every possible means. Yet the CHANCELLOR OF THE
    EXCHEQUER threw cold water on the efforts of certain firms to
    increase the sale by the offer of cash prizes, and thought it
    undesirable that this inducement should be imitated. The
    advocates of Premium Bonds were a little depressed by this
    announcement, but cheered up somewhat on observing that the
    conscientious CHANCELLOR has no intention of refusing the
    millions already raked into the Treasury by these "schemes of
    doubtful legality."</p>

             STREETS.
    </div>

    <p>On the vote for an increase of fifty thousand men for the
    Navy Mr. GEORGE LAMBERT solemnly announced that the Admiralty
    was "fumbling with a magnificent weapon." It is distressing to
    think that a body which for nearly ten years enjoyed his
    services as Civil Lord should have deteriorated so rapidly
    since he left it.</p>

    <p>Mr. LYNCH does not think much of the new scheme for securing
    unity of effort among the Allies. He called it "the analogue of
    the Aulic Council" (pronounced "Owlic," to give more effect to
    the description).</p>

    <p>The Chequers Estate Bill passed through all its stages amid
    a chorus of praise, despite the injunction of the generous
    donors that there should be "no flowers."</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, December 11th</i>.&mdash;After all, London is to
    have the BARNARD statue, despite the protest of Lord CHARNWOOD,
    LINCOLN'S latest biographer, that it is not a portrait of his
    hero, but of a man whose only connection with the PRESIDENT was
    that he was born in the same neighbourhood. Against this Lord
    WEARDALE quoted Mr. ROOSEVELT'S description of the statue as
    "the Lincoln we all knew and loved." As Mr. ROOSEVELT had
    reached the mature age of six when LINCOLN was assassinated the
    COMMISSIONER OF WORKS seems to have regarded his testimony as
    conclusive.</p>

    <p>At the request of Mr. KING the Peers are to be allowed to
    listen to the secret debates of the Commons, if any of them
    desire to do so. The hon. Member having expressed a hope that
    the Peers would grant reciprocal facilities to the Commons, Mr.
    HOGGE kindly suggested that the Government should grant him
    "all the privileges of the House of Lords." But Mr. BONAR LAW
    declined to deprive the House of Commons in that way of one of
    its brightest ornaments; so the "Mad Hatter" will not be called
    upon just yet awhile to exchange his traditional headgear for a
    coronet.</p>

    <p>I presume some Members of Parliament know what "non-ferrous
    metals" are, and what is the object of the Bill which the
    Government has introduced to deal with them. But the views
    which they took on the subject were so obscurely divergent that
    all I could gather from the debate was that in some way or
    other the measure was intended to be a nasty knock for German
    trade. That was good enough for the House at large, which
    passed the Second Reading by a substantial majority.</p>

        MR. JOSEPH KING.
    </div>

    <p><i>Wednesday, December 12th</i>.&mdash;Mr. PRINGLE, having
    asserted that candidates for appointments under the War Office
    were successful simply on account of possessing a "pull" with
    the Selection Department, was quietly reminded by the
    UNDER-SECRETARY that he himself had attempted to use his
    influence on behalf of a candidate. Mr. PRINGLE was righteously
    indignant. He had never asked favours of the War Office; he had
    merely "recommended men personally known to me." This delicate
    distinction, which should have convinced Members of Mr.
    PRINGLE'S disinterestedness, only made them laugh.</p>

    <p>On the Vote of Credit for 550 millions the CHANCELLOR OF THE
    EXCHEQUER was invited by Mr. DILLON to make a survey of the
    military situation. He replied that all the relevant facts were
    known already. "The War is going on; the Government and the
    country intend it shall go on; and money is necessary to make
    it go on." It is, perhaps, a pity that he did not content
    himself with this epitome and refuse to be drawn into a
    discussion of the recent operations near Cambrai. What has Mr.
    DILLON done to promote the prosecution of the War that he
    should receive special consideration?</p>

    <p>There was a renewed discussion of the censorship of
    pamphlets. Sir GEORGE CAVE ably defended the regulations, but
    did not convince everyone that his preference for confiscation
    over prosecution was entirely sound. The idea that the
    publishers of these pamphlets would welcome advertisement is
    probably erroneous, or why was it necessary to insist that they
    should put their names to them?</p>

    <p>Mr. SPENCER HUGHES'S humorous attack upon the CENSOR was
    much applauded on the Liberal benches. Some of the more
    brilliant passages would have received even wider appreciation
    if a good many Members had not heard them a week before from
    the lips of Mr. AUGUSTINE BIRRELL at a non-political
    luncheon.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, December 13th</i>.&mdash;Lord BERESFORD charged
    the PRIME MINISTER with having two voices, like
    <i>Caliban's</i> monster. Lord CURZON flatly declined to accept
    the suggestion that Cabinet Ministers were collectively
    responsible for one another's speeches&mdash;"they had far more
    serious things to think of." The phrase seems a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page417"
       id="page417"></a>[pg 417]</span> little depreciatory, but as
       Mr. LLOYD GEORGE, according to his candid colleague, is
       "constitutionally an optimist" he will no doubt make the
       best of it.</p>

    <p>Mr. HOUSTON was informed that sweets "for military, naval or
    civil consumption" were still being imported, but that the
    Ministry of Shipping made no special provision for their
    carriage. No one, therefore, need grudge Sir ERIC GEDDES the
    lozenge which he so ostentatiously popped into his mouth just
    before making his speech on Admiralty administration, or
    inquire too curiously whether it was consumed by him in his
    capacity of Major-General, Vice-Admiral or Civilian
    Minister.</p>

    <p>Despite the warning of the SPEAKER that it was not in the
    national interest to embarrass the Administration, Mr. KING
    insisted on trying to discuss forbidden topics. At last Lord
    ROBERT CECIL "espied strangers," and we must assume that,
    without the vivifying presence of the reporters, Mr. KING'S
    oratory wilted, for an hour afterwards the House was up.</p>

    <h2>THE V.C.</h2>

    <p>My cousin Agatha has been a bad correspondent ever since she
    married my old friend, George Thimblewell, which means for the
    past five-and-twenty years, so in ordinary circumstances I do
    not expect more from her than a "hasty line" to tell me how the
    youngsters are doing (George, of course, never writes at all).
    But I must say I was surprised and not a little hurt when, in
    the skimpy margin of a letter dealing mainly with the
    difficulty of devising breakfast-dishes, she scribbled in the
    most casual manner conceivable, "George has got the V.C. at
    last."</p>

    <p>George, my dear old school-chum, with the V.C., and his wife
    tells me of it as casually as if it had been a gumboil! I sat
    with her letter before me and looked back through the years,
    seeing us two&mdash;George and myself&mdash;as we were long
    before Agatha even knew him. Had I not fostered the yearning
    for heroic deeds in his young bosom? Was it not possible, nay
    probable, that the influence of his boyhood's companion had
    helped to mould his character and prepare it for this glorious
    if belated achievement? Upon my word it seemed to me that I
    myself might well take a certain amount of credit for that
    decoration. And here was his wife mentioning it as though she
    scarcely expected me to be interested. Never a date, never a
    detail.</p>

    <p>I was so ruffled that I decided, since she vouchsafed no
    information, to ask for none, as became a man with proper
    pride. I adopted a semi-jocular vein to meet the case.</p>

    <p>"I have known your V.C. longer than you have, Agatha," I
    wrote, "and am as pleased and proud as you can be. The strong
    silent type&mdash;you can rely upon them. Quiet and
    domesticated, requiring little attention, helpful about the
    house, undemonstrative perhaps, but all the time ready for the
    most desperate emergency. Let me know when George is to be at
    home, and I shall come to dinner and hear all about it."</p>

    <p>As I sealed my note it occurred to me that George must be
    the first special constable to win the Cross, and I felt a glow
    of satisfaction to realise that we must now be eligible for
    that most glorious of all decorations.</p>

    <p>A few days later came another note from Agatha, about
    sugar-cards this time, but with a postscript which said, "It
    isn't like you to chaff me, James. I don't see that there is
    anything particularly funny about George having got the Vacuum
    Cleaner which he promised me long ago."</p>

    <h2>THE BANK'S MISTAKE.</h2>

    <p>"I wish," said Francesca, "you would explain something to
    me."</p>

    <p>"I am full," I said, "of explanations of every conceivable
    difficulty. You have only to tap me and an explanation will
    come bubbling out."</p>

    <p>"I am not sure that I want the bubbling sort. On the whole I
    think I prefer the still waters that run deep."</p>

    <p>"Those too can be provided for you. All you have got to do
    is to ask."</p>

    <p>"What a comfort it is," she said, "to live constantly in the
    mild and magnificent eye of an encyclop&aelig;dia."</p>

    <p>"Yes," I said, "it saves a lot of running about, doesn't it?
    Come now, fire off your question."</p>

    <p>"What is your opinion of the Bank of England?"</p>

    <p>"The Bank of England?" I gasped. "One doesn't have opinions
    of the Bank of England. One just accepts it, you know, and
    there you are."</p>

    <p>"Yes," she said, "that's exactly what I felt about it. I
    thought it was one of the signs of our superiority to everybody
    else, with its crisp banknotes and all that."</p>

    <p>"You mustn't forget its detachment of the Guards to protect
    it. Many's the good dinner I've had with the officer of the
    Bank Guard in the old days."</p>

    <p>"I'm afraid that leaves me cold, not being able to take part
    in it."</p>

    <p>"If it gave me pleasure to dine at the Bank, I should have
    thought the subject would have interested you."</p>

    <p>"Well, it wasn't exactly what I wanted to consult you
    about."</p>

    <p>"What was it then?" I said. "You know you mustn't cast
    doubts on the financial stability of the Bank. You'll be put in
    prison if you do."</p>

    <p>"I shouldn't dream of doing anything of the sort."</p>

    <p>"Come, then, be quick about it. This suspense is making me
    tremble for my War Loan Bonds."</p>

    <p>"Is the Bank," said Francesca, "a generous institution?"</p>

    <p>"Banks," I said, "cannot afford to be generous. They are
    just and accurate and there's an end of it."</p>

    <p>"The Bank of England," she said, "being so great, is an
    exception to the rule. Anyhow, it has been generous to me, for
    it has given me one hundred pounds."</p>

    <p>"Do you mean," I cried, "one hundred pounds that don't
    belong to you?"</p>

    <p>"Of course I do. If they had belonged to me there wouldn't
    have been anything to make a fuss about."</p>

    <p>"This," I said, "is one of the most breathless things ever
    known. A mere woman, who is unskilled in finance and has only
    the dimmest recollection of the rule of three and compound
    interest, gets the better of the greatest banking institution
    in the world to the tune of one hundred pounds. It's
    incredible. Of course you've made a mistake."</p>

    <p>"That's right," she said. "Always go against your wife and
    think her wrong, even when it is only an institution that she's
    contending with."</p>

    <p>"It's precisely because it is an institution that I doubt
    your statement."</p>

    <p>"You're not very helpful; you don't tell me whether I'm to
    sit down under the burden of owning one hundred pounds of the
    bank's money that doesn't belong to me."</p>

    <p>"Francesca," I said, "you must calm yourself and tell me as
    clearly as possible how you came into possession of this extra
    hundred pounds which is apparently burning a hole in your
    pocket&mdash;if indeed you have a pocket, which I doubt."</p>

    <p>"You're quite wrong; I've got two pockets in the dress I'm
    wearing at this moment."</p>

    <p>"I will not," I said, "discuss with you the number of your
    pockets. Now tell me your pathetic story. I am all ears."</p>

    <p>"Well," said Francesca, "it's this way. I put one hundred
    pounds in the old War Loan, and then Exchequer Bonds came
    along, and I put one hundred pounds of my very best savings
    into them, and then came the new Five per Cent. War Loan, and
    somehow or other I got converted into that. And after that
    there was what they called a broken amount, which I brought up
    to fifty pounds or a multiple of fifty pounds. That cost me
    about forty pounds. I don't know why they wanted me to do it or
    why I did it."</p>

    <p>"Probably they thought it would be easier for the Bank."</p>

    <p>"That's paltry; easiness ought to have nothing to do with
    it."</p>

    <p>"Anyhow," I said, "I make out from your statement that you
    ought to have two hundred and fifty pounds of Five per Cent.
    Stock to your credit."</p>

    <p>"Precisely," said Francesca impressively, "but yesterday
    morning I received from the bank a dividend thing&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"You may call it a warrant," I said.</p>

    <p>"A dividend warrant," continued Francesca, "for eight pounds
    fifteen shillings on <i>three</i> hundred and fifty pounds, so
    what have you got to say now for your precious Bank of
    England?"</p>

    <p>"Your tale," I said, "has interested me strangely, but there
    is one point you omitted to mention."</p>

    <p>"I am innocent, my Lord," said Francesca. "I have told you
    the truth."</p>

    <p>"But not the whole truth, prisoner at the bar. Don't you
    remember that when the new Loan came out you borrowed money
    from me in order to take up one hundred pounds of it?"</p>

    <p>"Is <i>that</i> it?" said Francesca. "No, I hadn't
    remembered that."</p>

    <p>"Of course," I said, "a financial magnate like yourself
    would easily forget so wretched a sum; but the Bank has done no
    wrong."</p>

    <p>"Yes, it has; it sent out a lot of papers that were very
    confusing, and it's no wonder I made a mistake."</p>

    <p>"The question in my mind," I said, "is this: when are you
    going to repay what you owe me&mdash;with interest?"</p>

    <p>"We'll talk about that another time," said Francesca.</p>

    <h2>FOR OUR SAILORS AND SOLDIERS.</h2>

    <p>The Veterans Association is giving a Special Entertainment
    at the Alhambra on Sunday afternoon, December 30th, on behalf
    of their Imperial Memorial Fund which is being raised to expand
    the Veterans Club into an adequate Institution for the comfort
    of ex-sailors and ex-soldiers, and to provide an Imperial
    Memorial for those who have given their lives in the War. The
    Veterans Club in Hand Court, Holborn, has already done a great
    work during the six or seven years of its existence in looking
    after sailors and soldiers. Free medical and legal advice is
    given, and the homes of the men are protected by the storing of
    their furniture while they are on active service. Employment is
    also found for soldiers and sailors whose service is done. For
    the Entertainment at the Alhambra on the 30th, the following
    artistes, among others, have generously volunteered their
    services: Miss VIOLET LORAINE, Miss PHYLLIS MONCKMAN, Miss WISH
    WYNNE, Miss ESM&Eacute; BERINGER, Messrs. LAURI DE FRECE, MARK
    LESTER, HERBERT GROVER and GEORGE ROBEY.</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</h4>

    <p>One of the most interesting features, to an English
    observer, in the impressive spectacle of America girding
    herself for war is the sight of our great Ally passing through
    all those phases of initiation that to us are now remote
    memories. Such a phase is the coming of the first war-books,
    exemplified for me by the appearance of <i>From the Fire
    Step</i> (PUTNAMS). As his sub-title
    indicates&mdash;<i>Experiences of an American Soldier in the
    British Army</i>&mdash;the writer, Mr. ARTHUR GUY EMPEY, has
    proved himself something of a pioneer. In a singularly
    vivacious opening chapter he tells how, after waiting with
    decreasing expectation during the months that followed the
    <i>Lusitania</i> crime, he decided to be a law unto himself,
    and came alone to offer his personal service in the cause of
    freedom. You will hardly read unmoved (by laughter as much as
    by sympathy) his story of how this offer was at first refused,
    then accepted. Throughout indeed you must prepare to find Mr.
    EMPEY an entirely independent, though generous, critic of our
    men and methods; it is precisely this attitude that gives his
    book its chief interest as a survey of all-too-familiar things
    from a refreshingly new angle. I hardly suppose there will be
    anything in the actual matter, from church parade to
    gas-attacks, which readers on this side will not by now have
    seen or heard about, times beyond number; but one can imagine
    sympathetically with what concern it will all be received in
    the homes oversea; and after turning its high-spirited and
    encouraging pages can warmly echo the admonition of their
    writer: "Pacifists and small-army people please read with
    care!"</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Since there is probably no writer who can approach Mrs.
    FLORA ANNIE STEEL in the art of telling Indian tales about
    Indian people, one is specially happy to find her in
    <i>Mistress of Men</i> (HEINEMANN) with her foot once more upon
    her special terrain. Not for the first time, I think, she has
    gone to the records of the House of AKBAR for her material; the
    result here is hardly to be called a novel so much as amplified
    history, since it is really the life story of an actual (and
    wonderful) woman, NURJAH&Acirc;N THE BEAUTIFUL, wife of the
    Emperor JAH&Acirc;NGIR. Naturally the writer has experienced
    not only the great advantages but the hazards of such a
    building upon fact. To explain the marriage of your heroine
    with the Imperial lover by whose orders her first husband was
    killed, and not to lessen sympathy for her in the process, is a
    problem to test the skill of any novelist. One sees, however,
    even without Mrs. STEEL'S own declaration, that it has been for
    her a grateful task to set down "a record of the most perfect
    passion ever shown by man for woman." This was the adoration of
    the EMPEROR for his consort, an amazing romance of Oriental
    domesticity, which makes the story of the pair stranger and
    more fascinating than fiction. A love-tale indeed; and, since
    'tis love that makes a book go round, one may trust the
    circulating libraries to see to it that <i>Mistress of Men</i>
    is well represented on their shelves. As a study of an
    alluring, dazzling and masterful personality it was well worth
    writing.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>There is a sad interest in the title-page of <i>Irish
    Memories</i> (LONGMANS), since only by a pathetic fiction does
    it bear the names, as joint authors, of E. OE. SOMERVILLE and
    "MARTIN ROSS," those two gifted ladies whose association has
    been such a happy chance for them and for us all. Really the
    book, though in part compiled from the letters and journals of
    "MARTIN," is an eloquent tribute by Miss
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page422"
       id="page422"></a>[pg 422]</span> SOMERVILLE to the partner
       whose death has robbed her of a friend and the world of so
       much kindly laughter. But, haunted as it is by this shadow
       of bereavement, you must in no way think of it as wholly a
       thing of gloom. Looking back into the good years, the writer
       has recalled many incidents and scenes full of that genial
       and most infectious merriment that we have learnt to expect
       from her&mdash;tales of the wonderful peasant chorus that
       one remembers first in the pages of <i>An Irish R.M.</i>,
       exploits after hounds (it needs no telling how well both
       authors loved them), and much besides. There will be
       interest also for many uninitiated admirers in the account
       here given of how the famous stories came first into being.
       Of its more intimate and personal side I hesitate to speak;
       those who loved "MARTIN ROSS," either through her writings
       or in the closer relationship of friend, must be glad that
       her <i>ave atque vale</i> has been spoken, as she would have
       wished it, by her whose right it was. It will send many to
       read again those delightful volumes with a new appreciation
       of the sympathetic and lovable personality that helped in
       their making.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>I am afraid that something of the charm which, in a
    sympathetic preface, M. HENRI BORDEAUX claims for <i>A Crusader
    in France</i> (MELROSE) is veiled by a rather faltering
    translation. I would counsel all who appreciate the exquisitely
    sensitive <i>R&eacute;cit d'une Soeur</i>, with which he not
    unfavourably compares it, to go rather to the French original
    of these letters of a young captain of the famous Chasseurs
    Alpins. Captain FREDERIC BELMONT fell near the
    stubbornly-contested Hartmannsweilerkopf in 1916. He was the
    third of his family to give his life for France. The letters
    reveal a character that hardships and dangers not only
    strengthened but refined. He writes with a noble French ardour
    of his country in the crisis of her fate. He dreads, but rises
    greatly to the height of, his heavy responsibility as Captain
    at the age of twenty-one. The coveted cross of the Legion of
    Honour comes to him before the end, and he wins the affection
    and confidence of his men&mdash;a soldier's highest prize. A
    deep religious conviction unclouded by superstition sustains
    his courage. He is a product of the French Catholic tradition
    at its best. He writes intelligently of his work, and with a
    greater freedom as to detail than our more exigeant censorship
    allows; so that you get an excellent picture of the daily life
    of a campaigner in the greatest of all wars. He met the English
    in Flanders, admired and liked their looks and ways.... A very
    charming record of a gallant soldier, a chosen soul.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>In the first few pages of <i>At the Serbian Front in
    Macedonia</i> (LANE), Mr. E.P. STEBBING tells so many little
    anecdotes that I began to wonder if he was ever going to get
    there. When, however, he has got into his stride, he gives us
    information which is all the more valuable because we hear so
    little of the Macedonian campaign. Mr. STEBBING was appointed
    Transport Officer to a unit of the Scottish Women's Hospitals
    that was sent to the Serbian Front. Naturally he has much to
    say of the work done by these brave and untiring women. Under
    exceptionally difficult circumstances their courage never
    failed, and it is good to remember that their arrival at
    Ostrovo was of the greatest possible service to the Serbs. That
    is one part of the book, and it is well told. The other is of
    actual war, and here Mr. STEBBING was given ample opportunities
    to observe. No one can read his account of the taking of
    Kajmaktcalan without feeling the keenest admiration for the
    gallantry of the Serbs. He also describes very graphically the
    frontal attack by the French upon the Kenali lines in October,
    1916. The British public is too apt to look upon the Macedonian
    campaign as a prolonged picnic, and for them a dose of Mr.
    STEBBING would be excellent medicine. I wish someone with our
    own troops would do as sound a service for them as is done here
    for the Serbs and French. But let him avoid anecdotes.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>I am a little puzzled about <i>A Bolt from the East</i>
    (METHUEN). The publishers, who surely should know, call it "A
    modern and up-to-date romance, which deals mystically but
    boldly with the greatest and most pertinent of all
    questions&mdash;'Is Life Worth Living?'" But for my own part
    the greatest and most pertinent question suggested by Mr. G.F.
    TURNER'S up-to-date romance was whether it could possibly have
    been intended as serious. I despair of giving you any adequate
    idea of its contents. There are lots and lots of characters,
    and, as several of them seem to own more than one personality,
    it is often more than a little hard to say who is what. The
    central figure is an Indian Prince of marvellous beauty and
    mysterious powers, who, being jilted by the girl of his heart,
    wishes to be revenged upon the human race. To this end he
    employs the activities of a German Professor, who produces what
    one might call a <i>Kultur</i> of the sterility germ. However,
    these cheery projects go astray, though in precisely what
    manner I have no very clear idea. But the end came at a
    gathering where the <i>Prince</i> played psychic music, and a
    chance union of hands between hero and heroine transmuted the
    former from "a dilettante" and "polished ladies' man" to "a
    virile male filled with the blasting vehemence of primary
    passions." Incidentally it proved altogether too much both for
    the <i>Professor</i> and his inoculated rabbits, all of whom
    expired on the spot. Just about here that most pertinent
    question became more acute than ever. Fortunately it was the
    last page but one of the story.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of

freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
